# rpigaragedoor

A C program to control the garage door, and power outlet (ie: christmas lights / the like). The garage door fob is overriden such that the raspberry PI GPIO is able to cause the fob button to press. A keyfob is sacrifieced for this epic hack & hard wired to the raspberry pi in an enclosure. Other raspberry pi GPIO control relays which when activated, control power to an embeded household outlet.
